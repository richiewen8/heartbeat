<h1>
Getting Started with Linux-HA (heartbeat)</h1>

<h2>
Intro</h2>
Let me preface this document by saying most of this is _not_ original work.&nbsp;
My purpose for writing this document is just trying to contribute in some
way to possibly help those who REALLY get things done.&nbsp; The "work"
I am contributing is mostly compiling bits and pieces from other HA documents
(such as Volker Wiegand's Hardware Installation Guide) into a document
that can help novices get started on HA without pestering Alan (like I
did!) and to cut down on repeat questions on the mailing list.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Getting Started</h2>
The first thing you'll need is two computers.&nbsp; You need not have identical
hardware in both machines (or amount of memory, etc.), but if you did,
it would make your life that much easier when a component fails.
<p>Now you have to decide on some of your implementation.&nbsp; Your "cluster"
is established via a "heartbeat" between the two computers (nodes) generated
by the software package of the same name.&nbsp; However, this heartbeat
needs one or more media paths between the nodes.
<p>At this point, you're actually ready to begin hardware-wise.&nbsp; Of
course, since you're looking into HA, you'll mostly likely want to avoid
having only one point of failure.&nbsp; In this case, that would be your
null modem cable or serial port.&nbsp; So, you need to decide whether you
wish to add a second serial/null modem connection or a second network interface
card (NIC) to each node connected via a crossover cable.&nbsp; See Appendix
A for instructions on how to build a crossover cable.&nbsp; My setup goes
the 2 NIC route because I only had one null modem cable, had plenty of
NICs on hand and thought it was good to have two medium types for the heartbeats.
<p>Once your hardware is in order, you must install your OS and configure
your networking (I used Red Hat).&nbsp; Assuming you have 2 NICs, one should
be configured for your "normal" network and the other as a private network
between your clustered nodes (via the crossover cable).&nbsp; For an example,
we will assume that our cluster will have the following addresses:
<p>Node 1 (linuxha1):&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.85.1&nbsp; (normal 192x net)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.0.0.1 (private 10x net for heartbeat)
<br>Node 2 (linuxha2):&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.85.2&nbsp; (192x)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10.0.0.2&nbsp; (10x)
<br><i><font color="#FF0000">Note:&nbsp; Neither of the 192 addresses should
be your "cluster address" - the address handled by heartbeat and failed
over between nodes!</font></i>
<p>&nbsp; Red Hat makes this easy during installation (please don't think
I'm carrying their banner, it's just what I use), however, if you use another
distribution or are having any problems, refer to the Ethernet HOWTO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To check your configuration, type:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><tt>ifconfig</tt></b>
<p>This will show your network interfaces and their configuration.&nbsp;
You can obtain the same information in a less verbose form from "netstat
-nr"
<p>If it looks good, make sure you can ping between both nodes on all interfaces.
<p>Next, you need to test your serial connection.&nbsp; On one node, which
will be the receiver, type:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><tt>cat
&lt;/dev/ttyS0</tt></b>
<p>On the other node, type,:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><tt>echo
hello >/dev/ttyS0</tt></b>
<p>You should see the text on the receiver node.&nbsp; If it works, change
their roles and try again.&nbsp; If it doesn't, it may be as simple as
having the wrong device file.&nbsp; Volker's HA Hardware Guide and the
Serial HOWTO are two good resources for troubleshooting your serial connection.
<h2>
Installing Heartbeat.</h2>
You can now install the heartbeat package.&nbsp; If you're reading this,
you already have it, but in any case it's available at:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://linux-ha.org/download">http://linux-ha.org/download</a>
<p>Untar it into your favorite source directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; The RPM version
is available at the web site, or make your own RPM version, type "<b><tt>make
rpm</tt></b>" and use rpm to install.&nbsp; Otherwise, you can simply type
"<b><tt>make install</tt></b>".

<h2>
Configuring Heartbeat</h2>
<b><font size=+1>Configuring ha.cf</font></b>
<br>There are three files you will need to configure before starting up
heartbeat.&nbsp; First, is <i>ha.cf</i>.&nbsp; This will be placed in the
/etc/ha.d directory that is created after installation.&nbsp; It tells
heartbeat what types of media paths to use and how to configure them.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ha.cf in the source directory contains all the various options you
can use, I'll go through it line by line...
<dl>
<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>serial /dev/ttyS0</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -->&nbsp; Mandatory.&nbsp; Replace
/dev/ttyS0 with the appropriate dev file for your required serial heartbeat.</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>watchdog /dev/watchdog</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
Optional.&nbsp; The watchdog function provides a way to have a system that
is still minimally functioning, but not providing a heartbeat, reboot itself
after a minute of being sick.&nbsp; This could help to avoid a scenario
where the machine recovers its heartbeat after being pronounced dead.&nbsp;
If that happened and a disk mount failed over, you could have two nodes
mounting a disk simultaneously. If you wish to use this feature, then in
addition to this line, you will need to load the "softdog" kernel module
and create the actual device file.&nbsp; To do this, first type "<b>insmod
softdog</b>" to load the module. Then, type "grep misc /proc/devices" and
note the number it reports (should be 10).&nbsp; Next, type "<b><tt>cat
/proc/misc | grep watchdog</tt></b>" and note that number (should be 130).&nbsp;
Now you can create the device file with that info typing, "<b><tt>mknod
/dev/watchdog c 10 130</tt></b>".</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>bcast eth1</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
Specifies to use a broadcast heartbeat over the  eth1 interface (replace with
eth0, eth1, or whatever you use).</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>keepalive 2</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
Sets the time between heartbeats to 2 seconds.</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>deadtime 10</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
Node is pronounced dead after 10 seconds.</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>hopfudge 1</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
<i>Optional</i>.&nbsp; For ring topologies, number of hops allowed in addition
to the number of nodes in the cluster.</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>baud 19200</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
Speed at which to run the serial line (bps).</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>udpport 694</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
Use port number 694 for udp. This is the default, and the official registered
port number.</dd>


<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>nice_failback on</font></tt></b></dt>

<dl>
<dt>
<i>Optional.</i>&nbsp; For those familiar with Tru64 Unix, heartbeat acts
as if in "favored member"mode.&nbsp; The master holds all the resources
until a failover, at which time the slave takes over.&nbsp; Once the master
comes back online, it will take everything back from the slave.&nbsp; This
option will prevent the master node from re-acquiring cluster resources
after a failover.</dt>
</dl>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>node linuxha1.linux-ha.org</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
<i>Mandatory</i>.&nbsp; Hostname of machine in cluster as described by
`uname -a`.</dd>

<dt>
<b><tt><font size=+1>node linuxha2.linux-ha.org</font></tt></b></dt>

<dd>
<i>Mandatory</i>.&nbsp; Hostname of machine in cluster as described by
`uname -a`.</dd>
</dl>
<b><font size=+1>Configuring haresources</font></b>
<br>Once you've got your ha.cf set up, you need to configure <i>haresources</i>.&nbsp;
This file specifies the services for the cluster and who the default owner
is.
<br><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Note:&nbsp; This file must be the same
on both nodes!</font></i></b>
<p>For our example, we'll assume the high availability services are Apache
and Samba.&nbsp; The IP for the cluster is mandatory, and <b>don't configure
the cluster IP outside of the haresources file!</b>.&nbsp; The haresources
will need one line:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><tt>linuxha1.linux-ha.org 192.168.85.3 httpd smb</tt></b></pre>
<tt>So, this line dictates that on startup, have linuxha1 serve the IP
192.168.85.3 and start apache and samba as well.</tt>
<br><tt>On shutdown, heartbeat will first stop smb, then apache, then give
up the IP.&nbsp; This assumes that the command "uname -n" spits out "linuxha1.linux-ha.org"
- yours may well produce "linuxha1" and if it does, use that instead!</tt>
<p><tt><i>Note</i>:&nbsp; httpd and smb are the name of startup scripts
for Apache and Samba, respectively.&nbsp; Heartbeat will look for startup
scripts of the same name in the following paths:</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /etc/ha.d/resource.d</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /etc/rc.d/init.d</tt>
<p><tt>These scripts must start services via "scriptname start" and stop
them via "scriptname stop".</tt>
<br><tt>So you can use any services as long as they conform to the above
standard.</tt>
<p>Should you need to pass arguments to a custom script, the format would
be:
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>scriptname::argument</b></pre>
So, if we added a service "maid" which needed the argument "vacuum", our
haresources line would modify to the following:
<pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linuxha1 192.168.85.3 httpd smb maid::vacuum</b></pre>

<p><br><font size=+1>This brings us </font>to some added flexibility with
the service IP address.&nbsp; We are actually using a shorthand notation
above.&nbsp; The actual line could have read (we've canned the maid):
<pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linuxha1 IPaddr::192.168.85.3 httpd smb</b></pre>
Where <b><i>IPaddr</i></b> is the name of our service script, taking the
argument 192.168.85.3.&nbsp; Sure enough, if you look in the directory
/etc/ha.d/resource.d, you will find a script called IPaddr.&nbsp; This
script will also allow you to manipulate the netmask and broadcast address
of this IP service.&nbsp; To specify a subnet with 32 addresses, you could
define the service as (leaving off the IPaddr because we can!):
<pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linuxha1 192.168.85.3/27 httpd smb</b></pre>
This sets the IP service address to 192.168.85.3, the netmask to 255.255.255.224
and the broadcast address would default to 192.168.85.31 (which is the
highest address on the subnet).&nbsp; The last parameter you can set is
the broadcast address.&nbsp; To override the default&nbsp; and set it to
192.168.85.16, your entry would read:
<pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; linuxha1 192.168.85.3/27/192.168.85.16 httpd smb</b></pre>
You may be wondering whether any of the above is necessary for you.&nbsp;
It depends.&nbsp; If you've properly established a net route (independent
of heartbeat) for the service's IP address, with the correct netmask and
broadcast address, then no, it's not necessary for you.&nbsp; However,
this case won't fit everybody and that's why the option's there!&nbsp;
In addition, you may have more than one possible interface that could be
used for the service IP.&nbsp; Read on to see how heartbeat treats this...
<p>Once you straighten out your haresources file, copy ha.cf and haresources
to /etc/ha.d and you're ready to start!
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Selecting an Interface</h2>
One important aspect of configuring the haresources file for a machine
which has multiple ethernet interfaces is to know how heartbeat selects
which interface will wind up supporting the service addresses that are
configured in haresources.&nbsp; After all, no interface was specified
in the haresources file.
<p>Heartbeat decides which interface will be used by looking at the routing
table.&nbsp; It tries to select the lowest cost route to the IP address
to be taken over.&nbsp; In the case of a tie, it chooses the first route
found.&nbsp; For most configurations this means the default route will
be least preferred.
<p>If you don't specify a netmask for the IP address in the haresources
file, the netmask associated with the selected route will be used.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>Configuring Authkeys</font></b>
<p>The third file to configure determines your authentication keys.&nbsp;
There are three types of authentication methods available:&nbsp; crc, md5,
and sha1.&nbsp; "Well, which should I use?", you ask.&nbsp; Since this
document is called "Getting <i>Started</i>", we'll keep it simple......
<p>If your heartbeat runs over a secure network, such as the crossover
cable in our example, you'll want to use crc.&nbsp; This is the cheapest
method from a resources perspective.&nbsp; If the network is insecure,
but you're either not very paranoid or concerned about minimizing CPU resources,
use md5.&nbsp; Finally, if you want the best authentication without regard
for CPU resources, use sha1.&nbsp; It's the hardest to crack.
<p>The format of the file is as follows:
<br>auth &lt;number>
<br>&lt;number> &lt;authmethod> [&lt;authkey>]
<p>SO, for sha1, a sample /etc/ha.d/authkeys could be:
<br>auth 1
<br>1 sha1 key-for-sha1-any-text-you-want
<p>For md5, you could use the same as the above, but replace "sha1" with
"md5".
<p>Finally, for crc, a sample might be:
<br>auth 2
<br>2 crc
<p>
Whatever index you put after the keyword <b>auth</b> must be found
below in the keys listed in the file.  If you put "auth 4",
then there must be an "4 signaturetype" line in the list below.

<p>Make sure its permissions are safe, like 600.&nbsp; And "any text you
want" is not <i>quite</i> right.&nbsp; There's a limit to the number of
characters you can use.
<br>That's it!
<h2>
Starting and testing heartbeat</h2>
From Red Hat, or other distributions which use the SystemV style init files,
simply type /etc/rc.d/init.d/heartbeat start on both nodes.&nbsp; I would
recommend starting on the system master (in our example linuxha1) first.
<p>If you want heartbeat to run on startup, what to do will differ on your
distribution.&nbsp; For Red Hat (again, sorry) and Mandrake, you will need
to place links to the startup script in the appropriate init level directories.&nbsp;
I have heartbeat start last and only care about the 0(halt), 6(reboot),
3(text-only), 5(X) run levels.
<br>So, I needed to type in the following (as root, of course):
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /etc/rc.d/rc0.d ; ln -s ../init.d/heartbeat
K01heartbeat</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d ; ln -s ../init.d/heartbeat
S99heartbeat</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d ; ln -s ../init.d/heartbeat
S99heartbeat</b>
<br>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /etc/rc.d/rc6.d ; ln -s ../init.d/heartbeat
K01heartbeat</b>
<p>The last time I ran slackware, there was no /etc/rc.d/init.d directory
(may have changed by now) and to do the same thing, I would have placed
in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/etc/ha.d/heartbeat start</b>
<br>***This assumes you copy the file ha.rc to /etc/ha.d/heartbeat.&nbsp;
If you can't find /etc/rc.d/init.d with your distribution and you're unsure
of how processes start, you can use the rc.local method.&nbsp; But you're
on your own for shutdown, I just don't remember...
<p><i>Note:&nbsp; </i>If you use the watchdog function, you'll need to
load its module at bootup as well.&nbsp; For Red Hat, I put the following
command at the bottom of the /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit file:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>/sbin/insmod softdog</b>
<br>For the rc.local method, just put the same line right above where you
start heartbeat.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Once you've started heartbeat, take a peek at your log file (default
is /var/log/ha-log) before testing it.&nbsp; If all is peachy, the service
owner's log (linuxha1 in our example) should look something like this:
<br>heartbeat: 2000/01/18_14:26:45 info: Neither logfile nor logfacility

<p>
<hr WIDTH="54%">
<p><b>OK, </b>now try to ping your cluster's IP (192.168.85.3 in the example).
If this works, telnet to it and verify you're on linuxha1.
<br>Next, make sure your services are tied to the .3 address.&nbsp; Bring
up netscape and type in 192.168.85.3 for the URL.&nbsp; For Samba, try
to map the drive "\\192.168.85.3\test"&nbsp; assuming you set up a share
called "test".&nbsp; See Samba docs to get that going.&nbsp; As an aside,
however, you'll want to use the "netbios name" parameter to have your Samba
share listed under the cluster name and not the hostname of your cluster
member!
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">NOTE</font>: </b>If you can't bring up the
service IP address and you get ha-log entries similar to this:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIOCSIFADDR:
No such device</i>
<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIOCSIFFLAGS: No such

<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIOCSIFNETMASK: No such

<br><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SIOCADDRT: No such device</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
It <i>may</i> mean that you need to enable IP aliasing in your kernel build.&nbsp;
Check /usr/src/linux/.config for "CONFIG_IP_ALIAS=y" if you don't have
it, you'll have the line "CONFIG_IP_ALIAS is not set".&nbsp; Rebuild your
kernel with IP aliasing enabled.</blockquote>
If this all works, you've got availability.&nbsp; Now let's see if we have
High Availability :-)
<p>Take down linuxha1.&nbsp; Kill power, kill heartbeat, whatever you have
the stomach for, but <b>don't just yank</b> both the serial and eth1 heartbeat
cables.&nbsp; If you do that, you'll have services running on both nodes
and when you re-connect the heartbeat, a bit of chaos....
<br>Now ping the cluster IP. Approximately 5-10 seconds later it should
start responding again. Telnet again and verify you're on linuxha2.&nbsp;
If it happens but takes more like 30 seconds, something is wrong.
<p>If you get this far, it's probably working, but you should probably
check all your heartbeats, too.
<br>First, check your serial heartbeat.&nbsp; Unplug the crossover cable
from your eth1 NIC that you're using for your udp heartbeat.&nbsp; Wait
about 10 seconds.
<br>Now, look at /var/log/ha-log on linuxha2 and make sure there's no line
like this:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1999/08/16_12:40:58 node linuxha1.linux-ha.org:
is dead</b>
<br>If you get that, your serial heartbeat isn't working and your second
node is taking over.&nbsp; To avoid any problems, shut down heartbeat on
the first node, then test your null modem cable.&nbsp; Run the above serial
tests again.
<p>If your log is clean, great.&nbsp; Re-connect the crossover cable.&nbsp;
Once that's done, disconnect the serial cable, wait 10 seconds and check
the linuxha2 log again.
<br>If it's clean, congrats!&nbsp; If not, you can check /var/log/ha-log
and /var/log/ha-debug for more clues.
