#	There are lots of options in this file.  All you have to have is a set
#	of nodes listed {"node ...}
#	and one of {serial, bcast, or mcast}
#
#
#       Note on logging:
#       If any of debugfile, logfile and logfacility are defined then they
#       will be used. If debugfile and/or logfile are not defined and
#       logfacility is defined then the respective logging and debug
#       messages will be loged to syslog. If logfacility is not defined
#       then debugfile and logfile will be used to log messges. If
#       logfacility is not defined and debugfile and/or logfile are not
#       defined then defaults will be used for debugfile and logfile as
#       required and messages will be sent there.

#
#	A note on specifying "how long" times below...
#
#	The default time unit is seconds
#		10 means ten seconds
#
#	You can also specify them in milliseconds
#		1500ms means 1.5 seconds
#
#
#	keepalive: how long between heartbeats?
#
#keepalive 2
#
#	deadtime: how long-to-declare-host-dead?
#
#deadtime 10
#
#	warntime: how long before issuing "late heartbeat" warning?
#
#warntime 5
#
#
#	Very first dead time (initdead)
#
#	On some machines/OSes, etc. the network takes a while to come up
#	and start working right after you've been rebooted.  As a result
#	we have a separate dead time for when things first come up.
#	It should be at least twice the normal dead time.
#
#initdead 120
#
#
#	nice_failback:  determines whether a resource will
#	fail back to its "primary" node, or remain on whatever
#	node is serving it until that node fails.
#
#	The default is "off", which means that it WILL fail
#	back to the node which is declared as primary in haresources
#
#	"on" means that resources only move to new nodes when
#	the nodes they are served on die.  This is deemed as a
#	"nice" behavior (unless you want to do active-active).
#
#nice_failback on

#
#	Set up a multicast heartbeat medium
#	mcast [dev] [mcast group] [port] [ttl] [loop]
#
#	[dev]		device to send/rcv heartbeats on
#	[mcast group]	multicast group to join (class D multicast address
#			224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255)
#	[port]		udp port to sendto/rcvfrom (no real reason to differ
#			from the port used for broadcast heartbeats)
#	[ttl]		the ttl value for outbound heartbeats.  this effects
#			how far the multicast packet will propagate.  (0-255)
#	[loop]		toggles loopback for outbound multicast heartbeats.
#			if enabled, an outbound packet will be looped back and
#			received by the interface it was sent on. (0 or 1)

#       "Legacy" STONITH support
#       Using this directive assumes that there is one stonith 
#       device in the cluster.  Parameters to this device are 
#       read from a configuration file. The format of this line is:
#
#         stonith <stonith_type> <configfile>
#
#       NOTE: it is up to you to maintain this file on each node in the
#       cluster!
#
#stonith baytech /etc/ha.d/conf/stonith.baytech
#
#       STONITH support
#       You can configure multiple stonith devices using this directive.
#       The format of the line is:
#         stonith_host <hostfrom> <stonith_type> <params...>
#         <hostfrom> is the machine the stonith device is attached
#              to or * to mean it is accessible from any host. 
#         <stonith_type> is the type of stonith device (a list of
#              supported drives is in /usr/lib/stonith.)
#         <params...> are driver specific parameters.  To see the
#              format for a particular device, run:
#           stonith -l -t <stonith_type> 
#
#
#	Note that if you put your stonith device access information in
#	here, and you make this file publically readable, you're asking
#	for a denial of service attack ;-)
