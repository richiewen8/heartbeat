#
#	This is a list of resources that move from machine to machine as
#	nodes go down and come up in the cluster.  Do not include
#	"administrative" or fixed IP addresses in this file.
#	
#	We refer to this file when we're coming up, and when a machine is being
#	taken over after going down.
#
#	You need to make this right for your installation, then install it in
#	/etc/ha.d
#
#	These resources in this file are either IP addresses, or the name
#	of scripts to run to "start" or "stop" the given resource.
#
#	The format is like this:
#
#node-name resource1 resource2 ... resourceN
#
#	If the resource name contains an :: in the middle of it, the
#	part after the :: is passed to the resource script as an argument.
#       Multiple arguments are separated by the :: delimeter
#
#	In the case of IP addresses, the resource script name IPaddr is
#	implied.
#
#	For example, the IP address 135.9.8.7 could also be represented
#	as IPaddr::135.9.8.7
#
#	THIS IS IMPORTANT!!     vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
#
#	The given IP address is directed to an interface which has a route
#	to the given address.  This means you have to have a net route
#	set up outside of the High-Availability structure.  We don't set it
#	up here -- we key off of it.
#
#	The broadcast address for the IP alias that is created to support
#	an IP address defaults to the highest address on the subnet.
#
#	The netmask for the IP alias that is created defaults to the same
#	netmask as the route that it selected in in the step above.
#
#	The base interface for the IPalias that is created defaults to the
#	same netmask as the route that it selected in in the step above.
#
#	If you want to specify that this IP address is to be brought up
#	on a subnet with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, you would specify
#	this as IPaddr::135.9.8.7/24 .  
#
#	If you wished to tell it that the broadcast address for this subnet
#	was 135.9.8.210, then you would specify that this way:
#		IPaddr::135.9.8.7/24/135.9.8.210
#
#	If you wished to tell it that the interface to add the address to
#	is eth0, then you would need to specify it this way:
#		IPaddr::135.9.8.7/24/eth0
#
#       And this way to specify both the broadcast address and the
#       interface:
#		IPaddr::135.9.8.7/24/eth0/135.9.8.210
#
#	The IP addresses you list in this file are called "service" addresses,
#	since they're they're the publicly advertised addresses that clients
#	use to get at highly available services.
#
#	For a hot/standby (non load-sharing) 2-node system with only
#	a single service address, 
#	you will probably only put one system name and one IP address in here.
#	The name you give the address to is the name of the default "hot"
#	system.
#
#	Where the nodename is the name of the node which "normally" owns the
#	resource.  If this machine is up, it will always have the resource
#	it is shown as owning.
#
#	The string you put in for nodename must match the uname -n name
#	of your machine.  Depending on how you have it administered, it could
#	be a short name or a FQDN.

#
#	Simple case: One service address, default subnet and netmask
#		No servers that go up and down with the IP address

#
#	Assuming the adminstrative addresses are on the same subnet...
#	A little more complex case: One service address, default subnet
#	and netmask, and you want to start and stop http when you get
#	the IP address...
#
#just.linux-ha.org	135.9.216.110 http
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	A little more complex case: Three service addresses, default subnet
#	and netmask, and you want to start and stop http when you get
#	the IP address...
#
#just.linux-ha.org	135.9.216.110 135.9.215.111 135.9.216.112 httpd
#-------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#	One service address, with the subnet, interface and bcast addr
#       explicitly defined.

#       An example where a shared filesystem is to be used.
#       Note that multiple aguments are passed to this script using
#       the delimiter '::' to separate each argument.
