<a href="#nettools">Every time my machine releases an IP alias, it loses
the whole interface (i.e eth0)!&nbsp; How do I fix this?</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#manyIPs">I want a lot of IP addresses as resources (more than
8).&nbsp; What's the best way?</a></li>

<a NAME="FAQ"></a>Quit your bellyachin'!&nbsp; We needed a "catch-all"
document to supply useful information in a way that was easily referenced
and would grow without a lot of work.&nbsp; It's closer to a FAQ than anything
else.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="nettools"></a>This isn't a problem with heartbeat, but rather
is caused by various versions of net-tools.&nbsp; Upgrade to the most recent
version of net-tools and it will go away.&nbsp; You can test it with ifconfig
manually.</li>

<li>
<a NAME="manyIPs"></a>Instead of failing over many IP addresses, just fail
over one router address.&nbsp; On your router, do the equivalent of "route
add -net x.x.x.0/24 gw x.x.x.2", where x.x.x.2 is the cluster IP address
controlled by heartbeat.&nbsp; Then, make every address within x.x.x.0/24
that you wish to failover a permanent alias of lo0 on BOTH cluster nodes.&nbsp;
This is done via "ifconfig lo:2 x.x.x.3 netmask 255.255.255.255 -arp" etc....</li>
