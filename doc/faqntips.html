  <li> <a name="FAQ">Quit your bellyachin'!</a>&nbsp; We needed a
"catch-all" document to supply useful information in a way that was
easily referenced and would grow without a lot of work.&nbsp; It's
closer to a FAQ than anything else.</li>
  <li> <a name="what_is_it">HA (High availability Cluster)</a> - This is
a cluster that allows a host (or hosts) to become Highly Available,
that means if one node goes down (or a service on that node goes down)
another node can pick up the service or node and take over from the
failed machine. <a href="http://www.linux-ha.org">http://linux-ha.org</a> <br>
Computing Cluster - This is what a Beowulf cluster is. It allows
distributed computing over off the shelf components. In this case it is
usually cheap IA32 machines. <a href="http://www.beowulf.org">http://www.beowulf.org/</a> <br>
Load balancing clusters - This is what the Linux Virtual Server project
does. In this scenario you have one machine with load balances requests
to a certain server (apache for example) over a farm of servers. <a
 href="http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org">www.linuxvirtualserver.org</a> <br>
All of these sites have howtos etc. on them. For a general overview on
clustering under Linux, look at the Clustering HOWTO.</li>
  <li> <a name="res_scr">Resource scripts</a> are basically (extended)
System V init scripts. They have to support stop, start, and status
operations.&nbsp; In the future we will also add support for a
"monitor" operation for monitoring services as you requested. The
IPaddr script implements this new "monitor" operation now (but
heartbeat doesn't use that function of it). For more info see Resource
HOWTO.</li>
  <li> <a name="mon">Heartbeat itself was not designed for monitoring</a>
various resources. If you need to monitor some resources (for example,
availability of WWW server) you need some third party software. Mon is
a reasonable solution. <br>
1. Get mon <br>
http://kernel.org/software/mon/
    <p>2. Get all required modules listed. You can find them at nearest
mirror or at the CPAN archive (www.cpan.org). I am not very familiar
with Perl, so i downloaded them from CPAN archive as .tar.gz packages
and installed them usual way (perl Makefile.pl &amp;&amp; make
&amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install). </p>
    <p>3. Mon is software for monitoring different network resources.
It can ping computers, connect to various ports, monitor WWW, MySQL
etc. In case of dysfunction of some resources it triggers some scripts. </p>
    <p>4. Unpack mon in some directory. Best starting point is README
file. Complete documentation is in &lt;dir&gt;/doc, where &lt;dir&gt;
is place where you unpacked mon package. </p>
    <p>5. For a fast start do following steps: <br>
copy all subdirs found in &lt;dir&gt; to /usr/lib/mon <br>
create dir /etc/mon <br>
copy auth.cf from &lt;dir&gt;/etc to /etc/mon </p>
    <p>Now, mon is prepared to work. You need to create your own mon.cf
file, where you should point to resources mon should watch and actions
mon will start in case <br>
of dysfunction and when resources are available again. All monitoring
scripts are in /usr/lib/mon/mon.d/. At the beginning of every script you
can find explanation how to use it. <br>
All alert scripts are placed in /usr/lib/mon/alert.d/. Those are
scripts triggered in case something went wrong. In case you are using
ipvs on theirs homepage (www.linuxvirtualserver.org) you can find
scripts for adding and removing servers from ipvs list. </p>
  </li>
  <li> <a name="nettools">This isn't a problem with heartbeat</a>, but
rather is caused by various versions of net-tools.&nbsp; Upgrade to the
most recent version of net-tools and it will go away.&nbsp; You can
test it with ifconfig manually.</li>
  <li> <a name="manyIPs">Instead of failing over many IP addresses,
just fail over one router address</a>.&nbsp; On your router, do the
equivalent of "route add -net x.x.x.0/24 gw x.x.x.2", where x.x.x.2 is
the cluster IP address controlled by heartbeat.&nbsp; Then, make every
address within x.x.x.0/24 that you wish to failover a permanent alias
of lo0 on BOTH cluster nodes.&nbsp; This is done via "ifconfig lo:2
x.x.x.3 netmask 255.255.255.255 -arp" etc....</li>
  <li> <a name="serial">I</a>f anything makes your ethernet / IP stack
fail, you may lose both connections. You definitely should run the
cables differently, depending on how important your data is...</li>
  <li> <a name="nice_failback">Normal failback mode:</a> <br>
In this mode, one of the two machines is designated as the preferred
provider of a given resource group. If that machine is up, then it will
always be the provider of every resource group for which it is preferred
provider. Failovers occur when the preferred provider goes out of
service, and when it comes back (failback). This mode is required if
you wish to run an active-active configuration. <br>
Nice failback mode: <br>
In this mode, there is no natural affinity between a resource group and
a particular node in the cluster (haresources file notwithstanding).
Instead, there is an affinity between a resource group and whatever
machine it is currently running on. Failovers occur *only* when a
machine which is providing a service goes out of service. There is no
concept of failback in this mode. This mode minimizes service
interruptions, but cannot run an active-active configuration.</li>
  <li> <a name="firewall">To make heartbeat work with ipchains</a>, you
must accept incoming and outgoing traffic on 694 UDP port. Add
something like <br>
/sbin/ipchains -A output -i ethN -p udp -s &lt;source_IP&gt; -d
&lt;dest_IP&gt;&nbsp; -j ACCEPT <br>
/sbin/ipchains -A input -i ethN -p udp -s &lt;source_IP&gt; -d
&lt;dest_IP&gt;&nbsp; -j ACCEPT</li>
  <li> <a name="heavy_load">Since the default probably isn't reasonable
for most linux systems under heavy load</a> (sorry!), here is
suggestion: <br>
Set deadtime to 60 seconds or higher <br>
Set warntime to whatever you *want* your deadtime to be. <br>
Run your system under heavy load for a few weeks. <br>
Look at your logs for the longest time either system went without
hearing a heartbeat. <br>
Set your deadtime to 1.5-2 times that amount.&nbsp; Set warntime to
that amount. <br>
Continue to monitor logs for warnings about long heartbeat times. If
you don't do this, you may get "Cluster node ... returning after
partition" which will cause heartbeat to restart on all machines in the
cluster. Adding memory to the machine generally helps. Limiting
workload on the machine generally helps. Some newer versions of
heartbeat are a bit better about this than previous versions. </li>
  <li> <a name="authkeys">It's probably a permissions problem on
authkeys.</a>&nbsp; It wants it to be read only mode (400, 600 or
700).&nbsp; Depending on where and when it discovers the problem, the
message will wind up in different places. <br>
But, it tends to be in
    <ol>
      <li>stdout/stderr</li>
      <li>wherever you specified in your setup</li>
      <li>/var/log/messages</li>
    </ol>
Newer releases are better about also putting out startup messages to
stderr in addition to whereever you have configured them to go. </li>
  <li> <a name="multiple_clusters">Use multicast</a> and give each its
own multicast group. If you need to/want to use broadcast, then run
each cluster on different port numbers.</li>
  <li> <a name="CVS">There is a CVS repository for Linux-HA.</a> You can
find it at cvs.linux-ha.org.&nbsp; Read-only access is via login guest,
password guest, module name linux-ha. More details are to be found in
the announcement&nbsp; email.&nbsp; It is also available through the
web using viewcvs at <a
 href="http://cvs.linux-ha.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/linux-ha/">http://cvs.linux-ha.org/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/linux-ha/</a></li>
  <li> <a name="other_os">Heartbeat is currently being ported to use
automake.</a></li>
  <li><a name="RPM"></a>Due to distribution RPM package name
differences, this was unavoidable.&nbsp; If you're not using STONITH,
use the "--nodeps" option with rpm. &nbsp;Otherwise, use the heartbeat
source to build your own RPMs.&nbsp; You'll have the added dependencies
of autoconf &gt;= 2.53 and libnet (get it from <a
 href="http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet">http://www.packetfactory.net/libnet</a>).&nbsp;
Use the heartbeat source RPM (preferred) or unpack the heartbeat source
and from the top directory, run "./ConfigureMe rpm".&nbsp; This will
build RPMS and place them where it's customary for your particular
distro. &nbsp;It may even tell you if you are missing some other
required packages!</li>
  <li><a name="meatware"></a>You configure a "meatware" STONITH device
into the ha.cf file. &nbsp;The meatware STONITH device asks the
operator to go power reset the machine <br>
which has gone down.&nbsp; When the operator has reset the machine he
or she then issues a command to tell the meatware STONITH plugin that
the reset has <br>
taken place. &nbsp;Heartbeat will wait indefinitely until the operator
acknowledges the reset has occured. &nbsp;During this time, the
resources will not be taken over, and nothing will happen.</li>
  <li><a name="self_fence"></a>This is not something which heartbeat
supports directly, however, there are a few kinds of resources which
are "self-fencing".&nbsp; This means that activating the resource
causes it to fence itself off from the other node naturally.
&nbsp;Since this fencing happens in the resource agent, heartbeat
doesn't know <br>
(and doesn't have to know) about it. &nbsp;Two possible hardware
candidtates are IBM's ServeRAID-4 RAID controllers and ICP Vortex RAID
controllers - but do your homework!!!<br>
  </li>
  <li> <a name="last_hope">Please be sure that you read all
documentation</a> and searched mail list archives. If you still can't
find a solution you can post questions to the mailing list. Please
include following:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> What OS are you running.</li>
    <li>What version (distro/kernel).</li>
    <li>How did you install heartbeat (tar.gz, rpm, src.rpm or manual
installation)</li>
    <li>Include your configuration files from BOTH machines. You can
omit authkeys.</li>
    <li>Include the of your logs which describes errors.&nbsp; Send
them as attachments. <br>
Please don't send "cleaned up" logs.&nbsp; The real logs have more
information in them than cleaned up versions.&nbsp; Always include at
least a little irrelevant data before and after the events in question
so that we know nothing was missed.&nbsp; Don't edit the logs unless
you really have some super-secret high-security reason for doing so.
      <p> This means you need to send 6 or 8 files.  Include 6 if your
debug output goes into the same file as your normal output and 8
otherwise. For each machine you need to send: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ha.cf</li>
        <li>haresources</li>
        <li>normal logs</li>
        <li>debug logs (perhaps)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
