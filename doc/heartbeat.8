.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBheartbeat\fP is a basic heartbeat subsystem for Linux-HA.
It will run scripts at initialisation, and when machines go up or down.
This version will also perform IP address takeover using gratuitous ARPs.
It works correctly for a 2-node configuration, and is extensible to larger
configurations.
.PP
It implements the following kinds of heartbeats:
   * Bidirectional Serial Rings ("raw" serial ports)
   * UDP/IP broadcast (ethernet, etc.)
   * UDP/IP multicast (ethernet, etc.)
   * special "ping" heartbeats for routers, etc.

Comprehensive documentation on the configuration and running of
\fBheartbeat\fP can is supplied in HTML format with the distribution 
of the code. If this documentation is not installed on your system
