Package: heartbeat-ldirectord
Architecture: any
Depends: libwww-perl, libnet-ssleay-perl, logrotate, ipvsadm
Description: 
  ldirectord is a stand-alone daemon to monitor services of real
  for virtual services provided by The Linux Virtual Server
  (http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/). It is simple to install
  and works with the heartbeat code (http://www.linux-ha.org/).

Package: heartbeat-stonith
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: 
  The STONITH module (a.k.a. STOMITH) provides an extensible interface for
  remotely powering down a node in the cluster.  The idea is quite simple:
  When the software running on one machine wants to make sure another
  machine in the cluster is not using a resource, pull the plug on the
  other machine. It's simple and reliable, albeit admittedly brutal.

Package: heartbeat
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, logrotate, sysklogd
Description: Heartbeat subsystem for High-Availability Linux
 heartbeat is a basic heartbeat subsystem for Linux-HA.
 It will run scripts at initialisation, and when machines go up or down.
 This version will also perform IP address takeover using gratuitous ARPs.
 It works correctly for a 2-node configuration, and is extensible to larger
 configurations.
 It implements the following kinds of heartbeats:
   * Bidirectional Serial Rings ("raw" serial ports)
   * UDP/IP broadcast (ethernet, etc)
   * Bidirectional Serial PPP/UDP Rings (using PPP)
