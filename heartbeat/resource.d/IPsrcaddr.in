#
#	Based on the IPaddr script.
#
#	This script manages the preferred source address associated with
#	packets which originate on the localhost and are routed through the
#	default route.  By default, i.e. without the use of this script or
#	similar, these packets will carry the IP of the primary i.e. the
#	non-aliased interface.  This can be a nuisance if you need to ensure
#	that such packets carry the same IP irrespective of which host in
#	a redundant cluster they actually originate from.
#
#	It can add a preferred source address, or remove one.
#
#	usage: $0 ip-address {start|stop|status|monitor}
#
#	The "start" arg adds a preferred source address.
#
#	Surprisingly, the "stop" arg removes it.	:-)
#
#	NOTES:
#
#	1) There must be one and not more than 1 default route!  Mainly because
#	I can't see why you should have more than one.  And if there is more
#	than one, we would have to box clever to find out which one is to be
#	modified, or we would have to pass its identity as an argument.
#
#	2) The script depends on Alexey Kuznetsov's ip utility from the
#	iproute aka iproute2 package.
#
#	3) No checking is done to see if the passed in IP address can
#	reasonably be associated with the interface on which the default
#	route exists.  So unless you want to deliberately spoof your source IP,
#	check it!  Normally, I would expect that your haresources looks
#	something like:
#
#		nodename ip1 ip2 ... ipN IPsrcroute::ipX
#
#	where ipX is one of the ip1 to ipN.

#	We can distinguish 3 cases: no preferred source address, a
#	preferred source address exists which matches that specified, and one
#	exists but doesn't match that specified.  srcr_read() returns 1,0,2
#	respectively.
#
#	The output of route show is something along the lines of:
#
#		default via X.X.X.X dev eth1 src Y.Y.Y.Y
#
#	where the src clause "src Y.Y.Y.Y" may or may not be present

# Version 0.2  2002/11/02 17:00:00 John Sutton <john@scl.co.uk>
# Changed status output to "OK" to satisfy ResourceManager's
# we_own_resource() function.
#
# Version 0.1  2002/11/01 17:00:00 John Sutton <john@scl.co.uk>
# First effort but does the job?
