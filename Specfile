Summary: %PKG% - heartbeat subsystem for High-Availability Linux
Name:	%PKG%
Version:	%VERS%
Release:	%RPMREL%
Copyright: GPL
URL: http://linux-ha.org/
Group: Utilities
Packager: Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>

%description
%PKG% is a basic heartbeat subsystem for Linux-HA.
It will run scripts at initialization, and when machines go up or down.
This version will also perform IP address takeover using gratuitious ARPs.
It works correctly for a 2-node configuration, and is extensible to larger
configurations.

It implements the following kinds of heartbeats:
	- Bidirectional Serial Rings ("raw" serial ports)
	- UDP/IP braodcast (ethernet, etc)
	- Bidirectional Serial PPP/UDP Rings (using PPP)

     and Horms <horms@vergenet.net>

+ Version 0.4.8  BETA series
  + There is a serious memory leak in ldirectord vs 1.8. Parallel checking
    of http-server has been removed until the cause of the memory leak will
    be found. Use ldirectord vs 1.9 to be safe.
  + Made the order of resource takeover more rational:  Takeover is now
    left-to-right, and giveup is right-to-left
  + Changed the default port number to our official IANA port number (694)
  + Regularized more messages, eliminated some redundant ones.
  + Print the version of heartbeat when starting.
  + Hosts now have 3 statuses {down, up, active} active means that it knows
	that all its links are operational, and it's safe to send cluster
	messages
  + Significant revisions to nice_failback (mainly due to lclaudio)
  + More SuSE-compatibility. Thanks to Friedrich Lobenstock <fl@fl.priv.at>
  + Tidied up logging so it can be to files, to syslog or both (Horms)
  + Tidied up build process (Horms)
  + Updated ldirectord to produce and install a man page and be
    compatible with the fwmark options to The Linux Virtual Server (Horms)
  + Added log rotation for ldirectord and heartbeat using logrotate
    if it is installed
  + Added Audible Alarm resource by Kirk Lawson <lklawson@heapy.com> 
    and myself (Horms)
  + Added init script for ldirectord so it can be run independently
    of heartbeat (Horms)
  + Added sample config file for ldirectord (Horms)
  + An empty /etc/ha.d/conf/ is now part of the rpm distribution
    as this is where ldirectord's configuration belongs (Horms)
  + Minor startup script tweaks.  Hopefully, we should be able to make core
    files should we crash in the future.  Thanks to Holger Kiehl for diagnosing
    the problem!
  + Fixed a bug which kept the "logfile" option from ever working.
  + Added a TestCluster test utility.  Pretty primitive so far...
  + Fixed the serial locking code so that it unlocks when it shuts down.
  + Lock heartbeat into memory, and raise our priority
  + Minor, but important fix from lclaudio to init uninited variable.

     Mitja Sarp <mitja@lysator.liu.se>, Jacob Rief <jacob.rief@tis.at>
     and Guenther Thomsen <thomsen@cs.tu-berlin.de>

+ Version 0.4.7
  + Added the nice_failback feature. If the cluster is running when
	the primary starts it acts as a secondary. (Luis Claudio Goncalves)
  + Put in lots of code to make lost packet retransmission happen
  + Stopped trying to use the /proc/ha interface
  + Finished the error recovery in the heartbeat protocol (and got it to work)
  + Added test code for the heartbeat protocol
  + Raised the maximum length of a node name
  + Added Jacob Rief's ldirectord resource type
  + Added Stefan Salzer's <salt@cin.de> fix for a 'grep' in IPaddr which
	wasn't specific enough and would sometimes get IPaddr confused on
	IP addresses that prefix-matched.
  + Added Lars Marowsky-Bree's suggestion to make the code almost completely
	robust with respect to jumping the clock backwards and forwards
  + Added code from Michael Moerz <mike@cubit.at> to keep findif from
	core dumping if /proc/route can't be read.

     Mitja Sarp <mitja@lysator.liu.se>,
     and Guenther Thomsen <thomsen@cs.tu-berlin.de>,

+ Version 0.4.6
  + Fixed timing problem in "heartbeat restart" so it's reliable now
  + Made start/stop status compatible with SuSE expectations
  + Made resource status detection compatible with SuSE start/stop expectations
  + Fixed a bug relating to serial and ppp-udp authentication (it never worked)
  + added a little more substance to the error recovery for the HB protocol.
  + Fixed a bug for logging from shell scripts
  + Added a little logging for initial resource acquisition
  + Added #!/bin/sh to the front of shell scripts
  + Fixed Makefile, so that the build root wasn't compiled into pathnames
  + Turned on CTSRTS, enabling for flow control for serial ports.
  + Fixed a bug which kept it from working in non-English environments

* Wed Oct 13 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>,
     Volker Wiegand <wiegand@suse.de>, Rudy Pawul <rpawul@iso-ne.com>,
     Mitja Sarp <mitja@lysator.liu.se>,
     and Guenther Thomsen <thomsen@cs.tu-berlin.de>

+ Version 0.4.5
  + Mijta Sarp added a new feature to authenticate heartbeat packets
	using a variety of strong authentication techniques
  + Changed resource acquisition and relinquishment to occur in heartbeat,
       instead of in the start/stop script.  This means you don't *really*
       have to use the start/stop script if you don't want to.
  + Added -k option to gracefully shut down current heartbeat instance
  + Added -r option to cause currently running heartbeat to reread config files
  + Added -s option to report on operational status of "heartbeat"
  + Sped up resource acquisition on master restart.
  + Added validation of ipresources file at startup time.
  + Added code to allow the IPaddr takeover script to be given the
        interface to take over, instead of inferring it.  This was requested
        by Lars Marowsky-Bree
  + Incorporated patch from Guenther Thomsen to implement locking for
        serial ports used for heartbeats
  + Incorporated patch from Guenther Thomsen to clean up logging.
        (you can now use syslog and/or file logs)
  + Improved FreeBSD compatibility.
  + Fixed a bug where the FIFO doesn't get created correctly.
  + Fixed a couple of uninitialized variables in heartbeat and /proc/ha code
  + Fixed longstanding crash bug related to getting a SIGALRM while in malloc
	or free.
  + Implemented new memory management scheme, including memory stats

* Thu Sep 16 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>,
     Volker Wiegand <wiegand@suse.de>, and Rudy Pawul <rpawul@iso-ne.com>
+ Version 0.4.4
  + Fixed a stupid error in handling CIDR addresses in IPaddr.
  + Updated the documentation with the latest from Rudy.

* Wed Sep 15 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>,
     Volker Wiegand <wiegand@suse.de>, and Rudy Pawul <rpawul@iso-ne.com>
+ Version 0.4.3
  + Changed startup scripts to create /dev/watchdog if needed
  + Turned off loading of /proc/ha module by default.
  + Incorporated bug fix from Thomas Hepper <th@ant.han.de> to IPaddr for
	PPP configurations
  + Put in a fix from Gregor Howey <ghowey@bremer-nachrichten.de>
	where Gregor found that I had stripped off the ::resourceid part
	of the string in ResourceManager resulting in some bad calls later on.
  +  Made it compliant with the FHS (filesystem hierarchy standard)
  +  Fixed IP address takeover so we can take over on non-eth0 interface
  +  Fixed IP takeover code so we can specify netmasks and broadcast addrs,
	or default them at the user's option.
  +  Added code to report on message buffer usage on SIGUSR[12]
  +  Made SIGUSR1 increment debug level, and SIGUSR2 decrement it.
  +  Incorporated Rudy's latest "Getting Started" document
  +  Made it largely Debian-compliant.  Thanks to Guenther Thomsen, Thomas
	Hepper, Iñaki Fernández Villanueva and others.
  +  Made changes to work better with Red Hat 6.1, and SMP code.
  +  Sometimes it seems that the Master Control Process dies :-(

* Sat Aug 14 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>,
     Volker Wiegand <wiegand@suse.de>, and Rudy Pawul <rpawul@iso-ne.com>
+ Version 0.4.2
  + Implemented simple resource groups
  + Implemented application notification for groups starting/stopping
  + Eliminated restriction on floating IPs only being associated with eth0
  + Added a uniform resource model, with IP resources being only one kind.
	(Thanks to Lars Marowsky-Bree for a good suggestion)
  + Largely rewrote the IP address takeover code, making it clearer, fit
	into the uniform resource model, and removing some restrictions.
  + Preliminary "Getting Started" document by Rudy Pawul
  + Improved the /proc/ha code
  + Fixed memory leak associated with serial ports, and problem with return
	of control to the "master" node.
	(Thanks to Holger Kiehl for reporting them, and testing fixes!)

* Tue Jul 6 1999  Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com> and
     Volker Wiegand <Volker.Wiegand@SuSE.de>
+ Version 0.4.1
  + Fixed major memory leak in 0.4.0 (oops!)
  + Added code to eliminate duplicate packets and log lost ones
  + Tightened up PPP/UDP startup/shutdown code
  + Made PPP/UDP peacefully coexist with "normal" udp
  + Made logs more uniform and neater
  + Fixed several other minor bugs
  + Added very preliminary kernel code for monitoring and controlling
	heartbeat via /proc/ha.  Very cool, but not really done yet.

* Wed Jun 30 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>
+ Version 0.4.0
  + Changed packet format from single line positional parameter style
	to a collection of {name,value} pairs.  A vital change for the future.
  + Fixed some bugs with regard to forwarding data around rings
  + We now modify /etc/ppp/ip-up.local, so PPP-udp works out of the box
	(at least for Red Hat)
  + Includes the first version of Volker Wiegand's Hardware Installation Guide
	(it's pretty good for a first version!)

* Wed Jun 09 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>
+ Version 0.3.2
  + Added UDP/PPP bidirectional serial ring heartbeat
	(PPP ensures data integrity on the serial links)
  + fixed a stupid bug which caused shutdown to give unpredictable
	results

  + added new directives to config file:
    + udp interface-name
    + udpport port-number
    + baud    serial-baud-rate
  + made manual daemon shutdown easier (only need to kill one)
  + moved the sample ha.cf file to the Doc directory

* Sat Mar 27 1999 Alan Robertson <alanr@henge.com>
+ Version 0.2.0
  + Make an RPM out of it
  + Integrated IP address takeover gotten from Horms
  + Added support to tickle a watchdog timer whenever our heart beats
  + Integrated enough basic code to allow a 2-node demo to occur

    to run under IRIX.
  - Known Bugs
    - Only supports 2-node clusters
    - Only supports a single IP interface per node in the cluster
    - Doesn't yet include Tom Vogt's ethernet heartbeat code
    - No documentation
    - Not very useful yet :-)
