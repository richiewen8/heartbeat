The STONITH module (a.k.a. STOMITH) provides an extensible interface
for remotely powering down a node in the cluster.  The idea is quite simple:
When the software running on one machine wants to make sure another
machine in the cluster is not using a resource, pull the plug on the other 
machine. It's simple and reliable, albiet admittedly brutal.

Here's an example command line invocation used to power off a machine 
named 'nodeb'. The parameters are dependent on the type of device you 
are using for this capability.

stonith -t rps10 -p "/dev/ttyS5 nodeb 0 " nodeb
